## Outstanding Issue: Cloudflare Worker Not Serving HTML Files

**Problem:** Despite successful builds and deployments to Cloudflare Pages, the HTML files (e.g., `commands.html`, `taskpane.html`) are not reachable via their respective URLs (e.g., `https://ipg-taxonomy-extractor-addin.wookstar.com/commands.html`). The browser reports a "404 Not Found" error.

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken So Far:**

1.  **Verified `wrangler.toml` `[site]` configuration:** Confirmed `bucket = "./dist"` is correctly set, indicating static assets should be served from the `dist` directory.
2.  **Verified `src/worker.ts` logic:** Ensured the worker code uses `env.__STATIC_CONTENT.fetch(request)` to correctly access the static assets, matching Cloudflare Pages' default binding for static content.
3.  **Confirmed Cloudflare Dashboard KV Namespace Binding:** Verified that the KV Namespace binding for static content is correctly named `__STATIC_CONTENT` and points to the `__ipg-taxonomy-extractor-addin-workers_sites_assets` namespace.
4.  **Checked HTML file references:** Reviewed `commands.html` and `taskpane.html` to ensure they do not contain incorrect relative paths for their internal assets (they primarily rely on CDN links and webpack-injected scripts).
5.  **Updated `manifest.xml` `AppDomains`:** Corrected the `AppDomains` entry in `manifest.xml` to `https://ipg-taxonomy-extractor-addin.wookstar.com` to ensure security policies allow loading from the Cloudflare Worker URL.
6.  **Confirmed successful builds and deployments:** The Cloudflare Pages build logs indicate successful compilation and deployment of all assets, including `worker.js` and the HTML files.

**Current Status:** The issue persists. The worker is deployed and running, but it is not correctly serving the static HTML files from the `dist` bucket when accessed directly via URL. This suggests a potential misconfiguration in how Cloudflare Pages handles the `[site]` bucket or how the worker interacts with it for direct file access.

**Next Steps (for Claude Code):**

-   Investigate Cloudflare Pages' specific behavior for Workers Sites and direct asset access. There might be a subtle configuration required beyond `wrangler.toml` for direct URL access to HTML files within the `[site]` bucket.
-   Consider adding explicit routing in `src/worker.ts` for root-level HTML files if Cloudflare Pages' static asset serving isn't handling them as expected.
-   Verify the deployed files on Cloudflare to ensure they are present and accessible via the Workers Site URL (e.g., using Cloudflare's built-in tools or a `curl` command from a different location).
